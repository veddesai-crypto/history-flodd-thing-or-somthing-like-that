# History Flood

Hey! This is a fun little project I made. It makes your browser history look like you visited the page lots of times.  

---

## How it works
- You tell it how many times to add to your history.  
- It changes the URL a bunch of times really fast (`#flood1`, `#flood2`, etc).  
- When it’s done, you can go to `chrome://history` and see a bunch of entries from the same page.  

---

## How to use it
1. Go to the website (or open `index.html` on your computer).  
2. Type a number for how many history entries you want.  
3. Click **Start Flood**.  
4. Wait a few seconds.  
5. Check your history at `chrome://history` and see all the “floods”!  

---

## How to put it on GitHub Pages
1. Put `index.html` in a repo.  
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.  
3. Set source to main branch and root folder.  
4. Save.  
5. Open the link GitHub gives you.

## Stuff to know
- This doesn’t actually visit other websites.  
- It only changes the history on the page you’re on.  
- Don’t flood your teacher’s computer lol 😂  
- Only use it for fun on your own stuff.
